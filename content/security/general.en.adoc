Be conservative with what you put in production.::
	This rule is based on keeping your production systems as
	simple as possible.  Simple is always better than complex,
	they are easier to reason about and easier to secure, because
	it's simpler to know what's going on. The more complex your
	stack is, the harder it is to secure.

Use boring technology whenever possible.::
	Boring technology is well understood by a wider swath of
	people. It's been used enough that all the sharp edges have
	been worn down, and the hard corners that are left are well
	marked in documentation, people's knowledge, etc.  New tech
	is great, and sometimes  you need to use it, but if an
	older(but maintained) technology can meet your needs, you
	should use that first.  
	This is not to say you should use
	PDP-11's, they are no longer maintained.  You don't want
	to be like the Nuclear Missile silos in the USA link:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36385839[still using
	floppy disks]!  If nobody is maintaining the software
	you use, that means you are, and that's usually a bad
	position to be in security wise.

Limit exposure::
turn off unused things, erase unused software and
enable default deny policies.
	* This is one of the hardest things to manage, implement
	and maintain.  Software is usually developed with everything
	enabled, turned on and set in accept mode.  If you develop
	software, you should include tests with default deny policies
	enabled as well.  * This means firewalls on every machine,
	but also in software configuration, if you don't need Feature
	X, turn it off.  This is all about limiting exposure, the
	less that is exposed to bad people, the harder it is for
	them to get a foothold and break into stuff.  * If your OS
	installs a bunch of software you will never use, delete it.
	* Try not to install extra software on your production
	machines, your production instances probably don't need
	compilers, debuggers and the like, uninstall that stuff.
	The more minimal your production machines can be, the harder
	time a bad person will have once they do get in.

Provide Defense in Depth.::
	Single solutions are a horrible way to keep secure.

Fail early, fail often, and fail securely.::
	Verify that when things do go unexpectedly, you fail,
	fast, loudly and securely. An ATM vendor would go out of
	business in a hurry, if every time an ATM machine rebooted
	or broke, it would start spitting $20 bills from it's slot.
	Make your software behave sanely when it breaks.  It should
	report it's failure to you, and it should then do the right
	thing with the person calling it.  I.e. you probably don't
	want your website to start showing debug information to your
	end-users if it fails, as the debug information will likely
	show usernames and passwords, or at the very least show
	detailed implementation information for a determined bad
	actor to learn more about your system(s).

Keep up to date::
	link:https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/why-the-equifax-breach-is-very-possibly-the-worst-leak-of-personal-info-ever/[Equifax] is the largest recent reason for why keeping up to
	date software is a huge security win.  Most attackers are
	just as lazy as we are, and use known security exploits.
	Don't let the lazy ones walk off with everything.  Keep up
	to date with security releases.  Subscribe to your operating
	system(s) security release announcements and install the
	updates as soon as possible.  For when you reach outside
	of your OS software for solutions(which you should keep to
	a minimum if possible) keep up with the security and
	development of those, and be diligent.
