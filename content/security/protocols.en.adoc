There are a lot of areas around cryptography protocols and what one should do to accomplish various things, see the table below for a good summary of many different areas.

Another answer, if use link:https://vaultproject.io[Hashicorp's Vault] for most all of these areas, and let them make the hard crypto decisions for you.
