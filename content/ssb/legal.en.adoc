Scuttlebut and other services are open to the general public. The way scuttlebut works, we have no way to police or enforce any content.

If you are law enforcement, we require subpeonas for information, about a visitor. 
However, you should know that we probably do not have any information of use to your investigations.

Information we collect:

* IP address while a user is currently connected. Usually not logged past 24hrs.
* Data required for the https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/[Scuttlebut protocol].

You can email us at this domain: admin @ zie.one

We do store banned IP addresses for longer than 24 hours.  We have no metrics or analytic collection here and try to not use any javascript.
